                    <h2 class="mt-3">Writing</h2>
                    <p>For several years now, I've enjoyed writing fantasy. I started by writing short stories about my Dungeons and Dragons games. I would write character backstories, stories about what happened during our games, and imagine stories about things that happened between sessions. After doing this for a couple years or so, I played in a game where I had the urge to turn it into a book. That started the 5 year process of learning how to write a novel. Five years of writing and rewriting a draft until I was happy with it. Now, I've written a draft of the first book that I was happy enough with to send to an editor. Eventually, this will be a 4 or 5 book series and it has been a passion project that has inspired both my imagination and design career.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-3">Crafting</h2>
                    <p>I've dabbled in so many different crafts, it's hard to pick just one. I find cross stitching and crochet very relaxing. I've also enjoyed making jewelry. For a brief time, I made gel candles, but I don't have those supplies anymore. I have even done scrapbooking, which served me well in many assignments for my design classes. What can I say? I'm a sucker for stickers! I think crafting was the root of my design aspirations. All my life, I've made beautiful things. And I want to keep doing that, for work and for fun.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-3">Gaming</h2>
                    <p>I think it's good to balance productive hobbies with pointless ones. Where my other hobbies give me something to be proud of, gaming lets me simply relax. I can enjoy a bit of mindless fun, building a base to survive a zombie horde or get to max level with a character decked out in the most epic gear. Mostly, it's something fun I can do with my husband. I enjoy first-person shooters, like Call of Duty, but my favorite games are survival crafting games like 7 Days to Die. In fact, even in my gaming, I'm usually the one designing our base. So I guess I never really stop designing. It just takes different forms.</p>
